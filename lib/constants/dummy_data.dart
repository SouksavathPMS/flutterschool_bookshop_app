Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient. It equally applies to learning a new language, eating healthy, career transitioning, working out, writing a book, and managing a household. When you are focused on the goal, improvements are temporary. If you want to maintain this improvement, it should become part of who you are.",
